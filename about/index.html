This blog intends to share any idea, thought, or inspiration, I might have, in the form of blog posts or photographs.</p><p>In my day job, I work for the best toy manufacturer in the world, the LEGO® Group, creating digital experiences for kids of all ages. Here I work as Senior Manager focusing on the engineering parts of our kids portfolio; which includes LEGO Play and kids.lego.com. I highly encourage and practice a show-don&rsquo;t-tell approach to work; sometimes it is just a lot easier to communicate something by showing it, this can be using <a href=https://boblbobl.com/2020/09/23/make-your-presentations-fun/>power point</a>, a small prototype, or sometimes I even use video to tell a story.</p><p>In my spare time, I love making stuff. I would consider myself an amateur photographer, preferable taking photos with analog cameras such as the medium format Hasselblad 500 C/M. The subject is most often the streets around where I live in Aarhus, Denmark.</p><p>I’m a proud dad to a girl and boy (twins) and married to my lovely wife for the last 10+ years.</p><h2 id=contact>Contact</h2><p>So you want to get in touch, eh?</p><p>Here are some reasons for doing so:</p><ul><li>You have read the blog, like what you see, and want to know more about any blog posts.</li><li>You would like me to <a href=https://boblbobl.com/2020/09/22/seeking-speaking-opportunities/>speak at your conference or event</a>.</li><li>You think I am an all-round nice guy and just want to hang.</li></ul><p>If that is the case, you can DM me on <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/boblbobl/>LinkedIn</a> or <a href=https://twitter.com/boblbobl>Twitter</a>.</p><hr><p>Disclaimer: The opinions expressed on this blog are my own opinions and do not represent my employer’s view in any way, shape, or form.</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><span class=copyright>© Copyright
