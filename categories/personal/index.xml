Why wouldn’t I? A brand new iPad needs to be protected, right?
The case for the Screen Protector I bought the best screen protector money can buy, Paperlike. Paperlike is excellent for when using the Apple Pencil; it gives a bit of friction to the pencil to feel (and sound) a bit like paper when drawing or writing on the screen.</description></item><item><title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 2 - The Initial Prototype in Sinclair Basic</title><link>https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/17/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-2-the-initial-prototype-in-sinclair-basic/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 10:45:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/17/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-2-the-initial-prototype-in-sinclair-basic/</guid><description>Now it is time to write some actual code. As I described in a previous post, I want to create an initial prototype directly in Sinclair BASIC, which will allow me to test out the gameplay of the Awakeman game on a ZX Spectrum.
It has been a while since I coded in BASIC. My first job as a developer was to create small programs in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), so building this prototype will also act as a refresher to BASIC.</description></item><item><title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 1 - My Development Setup</title><link>https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/10/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-1-my-development-setup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 14:59:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/10/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-1-my-development-setup/</guid><description>With side-projects like this one, I tend to leave the project unchanged for weeks. Therefore, I have found it good practice to write down the explicit details about my development setup; it makes it a lot easier to return to a project set on pause for a while.
As a general rule-of-thumb, my development setup has to be as platform-agnostic as possible. I think this is good practice. It allows a broader audience to follow-along when doing tutorials like this one, and it makes me independent from whether my next primary computer would be a Mac or a Windows PC.</description></item><item><title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 0 - Defining the Project</title><link>https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/04/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-0-defining-the-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 16:24:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/04/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-0-defining-the-project/</guid><description>For sentimental reasons, I recently bought a ZX Spectrum from a dear colleague, but what to do with it? I could play games from my childhood, but why not make my own?! The Speccy, after all, was what created a generation of bedroom coders. Because of the 8-bit hardware limitations, this would be an excellent opportunity to flex my programming muscle, something I do not get to do all that often.</description></item><item><title>Revisiting My Workplace Manifesto</title><link>https://boblbobl.com/2020/10/04/revisiting-my-workplace-manifesto/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 07:56:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.com/2020/10/04/revisiting-my-workplace-manifesto/</guid><description>In July 2013, I posted my workplace manifesto on a Tumblr blog I had back then. It was a list of five priorities I wanted for a current – or future workplace; some of them felt a bit far-fetched or maybe even utopian, so how do they stack up today?
The Manifesto Without further ado here is the manifesto:
Be able to work on projects that excite you! Be able to put in the hours to finish the project and NOT be bound by the project’s price-tag.</description></item><item><title>My 2020 New Years Resolution</title><link>https://boblbobl.com/2020/01/02/my-2020-new-years-resolution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 00:52:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.com/2020/01/02/my-2020-new-years-resolution/</guid><description>Although I’m not a big fan of New Year’s resolutions, I like the idea of a new year = new habits, so here are mine:
Start blogging again Quit social media and YouTube Start lifelogging …and here is why:
Make a Personal Blog I used to write more in my previous jobs as a developer and solution architect but stopped about six years ago when I started working in my current position at LEGO.</description></item></channel></rss>
