I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but it seems to be our ways-of-working when it comes to planning, road-mapping, or defining objectives. We have this idea that planning only involves the product owner/lead/manager and relevant stakeholders. We tend to have a non-transparent process of what the quarterly - or half-year plans will look like until we do the final unveil at the next &amp;ldquo;kick-off&amp;rdquo; with the rest of the team.</description></item><item><title>Revisiting My Workplace Manifesto</title><link>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/10/04/revisiting-my-workplace-manifesto/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 07:56:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/10/04/revisiting-my-workplace-manifesto/</guid><description>In July 2013, I posted my workplace manifesto on a Tumblr blog I had back then. It was a list of five priorities I wanted for a current – or future workplace; some of them felt a bit far-fetched or maybe even utopian, so how do they stack up today?
The Manifesto Without further ado here is the manifesto:
Be able to work on projects that excite you! Be able to put in the hours to finish the project and NOT be bound by the project’s price-tag.</description></item><item><title>Making OKR Work for Small Development Teams</title><link>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/09/28/making-okr-work-for-small-development-teams/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 09:48:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/09/28/making-okr-work-for-small-development-teams/</guid><description>A current trend in our industry is to formulate your goals as Objectives and Key Results (or OKR). However, there are a few challenges when implementing OKR, especially on a team level.
This post is an overview of how we use (or misuse) OKR on a small development team.
To give you a little context, our team consists of 3 developers and a product owner (that is I). We have a daily stand-up every day at noon and do refinement session once a week.</description></item><item><title>Make Your Presentations Fun</title><link>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/09/23/make-your-presentations-fun/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2020 09:52:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/09/23/make-your-presentations-fun/</guid><description>When asked to do a presentation about something or the other, I struggle to find the motivation from time-to-time. Here are a few tips on what I do when preparing for a talk.
To quickly summarize, these are the steps I go through:
Somehow make the subject exciting Challenge myself Think about the presentation; can I make this entertaining to the participants Make the Subject Exciting Often I am asked to make a presentation about something I know by heart, which is great because this means that I probably have a presentation already on the subject tucked away somewhere that I can reuse.</description></item><item><title>Seeking Speaking Opportunities</title><link>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/09/22/seeking-speaking-opportunities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:14:29 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/09/22/seeking-speaking-opportunities/</guid><description>I work as a Lead Platform Architect at the LEGO Group, where I am the acting product owner of our analytics platform supporting the digital consumer space. In my spare time, I like to work on old retro 8-bit computers.
I have some experience speaking internally and externally. I would, however, like to sharpen that tool even further. Therefore, I am seeking speaking opportunities outside of my work, be it conferences or local events (virtual or in-person).</description></item></channel></rss>
