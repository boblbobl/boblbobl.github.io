I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but it seems to be our ways-of-working when it comes to planning, road-mapping, or defining objectives. We have this idea that planning only involves the product owner/lead/manager and relevant stakeholders. We tend to have a non-transparent process of what the quarterly - or half-year plans will look like until we do the final unveil at the next &amp;ldquo;kick-off&amp;rdquo; with the rest of the team.</description></item><item><title>Revisiting My Workplace Manifesto</title><link>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/10/04/revisiting-my-workplace-manifesto/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 23:39:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/10/04/revisiting-my-workplace-manifesto/</guid><description>In July 2013, I posted my workplace manifesto on a Tumblr blog I had back then. It was a list of five priorities I wanted for a current – or future workplace; some of them felt a bit far-fetched or maybe even utopian, so how do they stack up today?

Be able to put in the hours to finish the project and NOT be bound by the project’s price-tag.</description></item><item><title>Making OKR Work for Small Development Teams</title><link>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/09/28/making-okr-work-for-small-development-teams/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 23:53:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://boblbobl.github.io/2020/09/28/making-okr-work-for-small-development-teams/</guid><description>A current trend in our industry is to formulate your goals as Objectives and Key Results (or OKR). However, there are a few challenges when implementing OKR, especially on a team level.
This post is an overview of how we use (or misuse) OKR on a small development team.
To give you a little context, our team consists of 3 developers and a product owner (that is I). We have a daily stand-up every day at noon and do refinement session once a week.</description></item></channel></rss>
