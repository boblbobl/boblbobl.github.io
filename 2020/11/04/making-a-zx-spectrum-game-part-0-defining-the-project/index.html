I could play games from my childhood, but why not make my own?! The Speccy, after all, was what created a generation of bedroom coders. Because of the 8-bit hardware limitations, this would be an excellent opportunity to flex my programming muscle, something I do not get to do all that often.</p><p>This post will be the first of many, where I will try to make a game for the ZX Spectrum. Here is what I have planed I will be covering:</p><ul><li><a href=https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/10/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-1-my-development-setup/>Part 1. My Development Setup</a></li><li><a href=https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/17/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-2-the-initial-prototype-in-sinclair-basic/>Part 2. Prototyping in Sinclair BASIC</a></li><li>Part 3. Cross-compiling using ZX Basic</li><li>Part 4. Sprites and Animation</li><li>Part 5. Running the Game on actual Hardware</li></ul><p>It would also be fun to do a loading screen, make some SFX, and support joystick input as well, but let’s see how far I get.</p><h2 id=the-game>The Game</h2><p>I was inspired to do this project after watching <a href=https://youtu.be/cN8v2UTENSo>a talk</a> by <a href=https://drjosh.dev/>Josh Deprez</a>, where he created a game for a Macintosh Plus, so it makes only perfect sense that I make a ZX Spectrum port of that game (with Josh’s permission of course).</p><p>The objective of the game is simple. You play as <a href=https://awakeman.com/>Awakeman</a>. Awakeman can pick up limes that are scattered around the screen. For each lime you pick up, you earn a point. Simple, right?</p><p><figure><img src=/images/posts/awakeman-macintosh.png alt="Screenshot of Limes" title="Screenshot of Limes, an Awakeman game by Josh Deprez running in the Mini vMac emulator"><figcaption>Screenshot of Limes, an Awakeman game by Josh Deprez running in the Mini vMac emulator</figcaption></figure></p><p>Although the game is simple, it is perfect for demonstrating how to make a game for the ZX Spectrum, and there are lots of opportunities to extend the gameplay even further if needed.</p><h2 id=stay-tuned>Stay Tuned</h2><p>For the upcoming weeks, I will be sharing my progress getting from zero to a fully functional game running on my ZX Spectrum, so stay tuned.</p></div><div class=tags><a href=https://boblbobl.com/tags/8-bit>8-bit</a>
