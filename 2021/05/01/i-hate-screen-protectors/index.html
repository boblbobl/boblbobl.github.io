A brand new iPad needs to be protected, right?</p><h2 id=the-case-for-the-screen-protector>The case for the Screen Protector</h2><p>I bought the best screen protector money can buy, <a href=https://paperlike.com/>Paperlike</a>. Paperlike is excellent for when using the Apple Pencil; it gives a bit of friction to the pencil to feel (and sound) a bit like paper when drawing or writing on the screen. In addition, the Paperlike screen protector also gives a matte surface to the screen, making it more resistant to sunlight.</p><p>The general idea of the screen protector is, by applying a thin layer of protectective material on top of the iPad’s touch screen, it will catch those scratches that otherwise would have ended up your screen instead.</p><h2 id=the-frustration-of-installation>The Frustration of Installation</h2><p>The thing is, every time I try to install a screen protector, I magically manage to fuck it up. Although I made sure that my work surface and screen were ultra-clean before adding the screen protector, I always seem to capture a speck of dust under it, which is very noticeable. And even if it was not evident, the fact that I know the dust is there, is enough for my OCD to go haywire.</p><h2 id=does-it-really-matter>Does it Really Matter?</h2><p>So does a screen protector on top of the iPads already scratch- and oil-resistant glass add any additional protection, which is not already built into the product itself? Unlike my phone, when the iPad is thrown into my bag, I always have a cover on it. I carry around my phone in my pocket all day, without a screen protector or cover on it, and I have not seen any scratches caused by dirt or sand accumulated in by pockets.</p><p>In addition, the matte surface of the Paperlike screen protector degrades the image quality of the screen, which is especially visible when viewing a white background. It is not a deal-breaker by any means but something I need to live with when using the iPad to edit my photos.</p><p>The dust particle trapped behind my screen protector made me think, is there really a need for a screen protector? Is adding the nano-coded friction of the Paperlike really worth the objectively downgrade in image quality from leaving the screen bare? Can I live with the forever trapped dust particle on the iPad screen?</p><p>So what to do?, Do I keep the screen protector or do I throw it out, wasting €34 in the process?</p></div><div class=tags><a href=https://boblbobl.com/tags/screen>screen</a>
