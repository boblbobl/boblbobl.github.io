In my spare time, I like to work on old retro 8-bit computers.
I have some experience speaking internally and externally. I would, however, like to sharpen that tool even further.

However, I miss having a voice outside of what I do every day, and when given the change/permission, I would also love to share the things I work on there.</div></section></a><div class=pagination><span class=prev><a href=/><span class=arrow>←</span> Newer Posts</a></span></div></div></main><footer id=footer><span class=copyright>© Copyright
