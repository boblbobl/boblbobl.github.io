&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Start blogging again&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quit social media and YouTube&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start lifelogging&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I used to write more in my previous jobs as a developer and solution architect but stopped about six years ago when I started working in my current position at LEGO.

However, I miss having a voice outside of what I do every day, and when given the change/permission, I would also love to share the things I work on there.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
