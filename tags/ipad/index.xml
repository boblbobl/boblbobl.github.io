Why wouldnâ€™t I? A brand new iPad needs to be protected, right?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I bought the best screen protector money can buy, &lt;a href="https://paperlike.com/" >Paperlike&lt;/a>. Paperlike is excellent for when using the Apple Pencil; it gives a bit of friction to the pencil to feel (and sound) a bit like paper when drawing or writing on the screen. In addition, the Paperlike screen protector also gives a matte surface to the screen, making it more resistant to sunlight.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
