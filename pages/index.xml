This blog intends to share any idea, thought, or inspiration, I might have, in the form of blog posts or photographs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my day job, I work for the best toy manufacturer in the world, the LEGO® Group, creating digital experiences for kids of all ages. Here I work as Senior Manager focusing on the engineering parts of our kids portfolio; which includes LEGO Play and kids.lego.com. I highly encourage and practice a show-don&amp;rsquo;t-tell approach to work; sometimes it is just a lot easier to communicate something by showing it, this can be using &lt;a href="https://boblbobl.com/2020/09/23/make-your-presentations-fun/" >power point&lt;/a>, a small prototype, or sometimes I even use video to tell a story.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
