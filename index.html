Why wouldn’t I? A brand new iPad needs to be protected, right?
The case for the Screen Protector I bought the best screen protector money can buy, Paperlike. Paperlike is excellent for when using the Apple Pencil; it gives a bit of friction to the pencil to feel (and sound) a bit like paper when drawing or writing on the screen.</div></section></a><a href=/2021/01/15/planning-in-the-dark/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Planning in the Dark</h2><div class=date>Jan 15, 2021</div></div><div class=summary>Why are we so afraid to show temporary or early drafts of plans to our teams, and why are we so obsessed with planning reveals at kick-offs?
I don’t know, but it seems to be our ways-of-working when it comes to planning, road-mapping, or defining objectives. We have this idea that planning only involves the product owner/lead/manager and relevant stakeholders. We tend to have a non-transparent process of what the quarterly - or half-year plans will look like until we do the final unveil at the next “kick-off” with the rest of the team.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/11/17/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-2-the-initial-prototype-in-sinclair-basic/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 2 - The Initial Prototype in Sinclair Basic</h2><div class=date>Nov 17, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>Now it is time to write some actual code. As I described in a previous post, I want to create an initial prototype directly in Sinclair BASIC, which will allow me to test out the gameplay of the Awakeman game on a ZX Spectrum.
It has been a while since I coded in BASIC. My first job as a developer was to create small programs in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), so building this prototype will also act as a refresher to BASIC.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/11/10/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-1-my-development-setup/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 1 - My Development Setup</h2><div class=date>Nov 10, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>With side-projects like this one, I tend to leave the project unchanged for weeks. Therefore, I have found it good practice to write down the explicit details about my development setup; it makes it a lot easier to return to a project set on pause for a while.
As a general rule-of-thumb, my development setup has to be as platform-agnostic as possible. I think this is good practice. It allows a broader audience to follow-along when doing tutorials like this one, and it makes me independent from whether my next primary computer would be a Mac or a Windows PC.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/11/04/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-0-defining-the-project/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 0 - Defining the Project</h2><div class=date>Nov 4, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>For sentimental reasons, I recently bought a ZX Spectrum from a dear colleague, but what to do with it? I could play games from my childhood, but why not make my own?! The Speccy, after all, was what created a generation of bedroom coders. Because of the 8-bit hardware limitations, this would be an excellent opportunity to flex my programming muscle, something I do not get to do all that often.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/10/04/revisiting-my-workplace-manifesto/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Revisiting My Workplace Manifesto</h2><div class=date>Oct 4, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>In July 2013, I posted my workplace manifesto on a Tumblr blog I had back then. It was a list of five priorities I wanted for a current – or future workplace; some of them felt a bit far-fetched or maybe even utopian, so how do they stack up today?
The Manifesto Without further ado here is the manifesto:
Be able to work on projects that excite you! Be able to put in the hours to finish the project and NOT be bound by the project’s price-tag.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/09/28/making-okr-work-for-small-development-teams/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making OKR Work for Small Development Teams</h2><div class=date>Sep 28, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>A current trend in our industry is to formulate your goals as Objectives and Key Results (or OKR). However, there are a few challenges when implementing OKR, especially on a team level.
This post is an overview of how we use (or misuse) OKR on a small development team.
To give you a little context, our team consists of 3 developers and a product owner (that is I). We have a daily stand-up every day at noon and do refinement session once a week.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/09/23/make-your-presentations-fun/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Make Your Presentations Fun</h2><div class=date>Sep 23, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>When asked to do a presentation about something or the other, I struggle to find the motivation from time-to-time. Here are a few tips on what I do when preparing for a talk.
To quickly summarize, these are the steps I go through:
Somehow make the subject exciting Challenge myself Think about the presentation; can I make this entertaining to the participants Make the Subject Exciting Often I am asked to make a presentation about something I know by heart, which is great because this means that I probably have a presentation already on the subject tucked away somewhere that I can reuse.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/09/22/seeking-speaking-opportunities/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Seeking Speaking Opportunities</h2><div class=date>Sep 22, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>I work as a Lead Platform Architect at the LEGO Group, where I am the acting product owner of our analytics platform supporting the digital consumer space. In my spare time, I like to work on old retro 8-bit computers.
I have some experience speaking internally and externally. I would, however, like to sharpen that tool even further. Therefore, I am seeking speaking opportunities outside of my work, be it conferences or local events (virtual or in-person).</div></section></a><a href=/2020/01/02/my-2020-new-years-resolution/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>My 2020 New Years Resolution</h2><div class=date>Jan 2, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>Although I’m not a big fan of New Year’s resolutions, I like the idea of a new year = new habits, so here are mine:
