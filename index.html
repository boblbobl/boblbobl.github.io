Why wouldn’t I? A brand new iPad needs to be protected, right?
The case for the Screen Protector I bought the best screen protector money can buy, Paperlike. Paperlike is excellent for when using the Apple Pencil; it gives a bit of friction to the pencil to feel (and sound) a bit like paper when drawing or writing on the screen.</div></section></a><a href=/2021/01/15/planning-in-the-dark/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Planning in the Dark</h2><div class=date>Jan 15, 2021</div></div><div class=summary>Why are we so afraid to show temporary or early drafts of plans to our teams, and why are we so obsessed with planning reveals at kick-offs?
I don’t know, but it seems to be our ways-of-working when it comes to planning, road-mapping, or defining objectives. We have this idea that planning only involves the product owner/lead/manager and relevant stakeholders. We tend to have a non-transparent process of what the quarterly - or half-year plans will look like until we do the final unveil at the next “kick-off” with the rest of the team.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/12/01/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-4-graphics/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 4 - Graphics</h2><div class=date>Dec 1, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>I have now come to the point, where I would like to add a bit more graphics to the prototype. Instead of having basic characters act as standins for the graphics, why not do the actual graphics themselves. To start with, I would like to render a lime instead of the “@” character.
Before I can begin, I need to better understand the graphics capabilities of the ZX Spectrum and what options there are.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/11/24/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-3-cross-compiling-in-zx-basic/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 3 - Cross Compiling in ZX Basic</h2><div class=date>Nov 24, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>The time has come to look into cross compiling my code for the ZX Spectrum. As I alluded to in part 1 of the series, I intend to use ZXBASIC for cross compiling, which also means I can basically take (no pun intended) the prototype already writen in Sinclair BASIC and rewrite it in ZXBASIC.
The advantage of ZXBASIC, besides compiling to assembler, is that it is also a modern take or dialect on BASIC (especially when compared to Sinclair BASIC), where it tries to keep some of the original Sinclair BASIC features, which definitely eases the transition from one language to the other, but it also offers features of a cross compiled language, such as data types and the possibility to do inline assembly code.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/11/17/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-2-the-initial-prototype-in-sinclair-basic/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 2 - The Initial Prototype in Sinclair Basic</h2><div class=date>Nov 17, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>Now it is time to write some actual code. As I described in a previous post, I want to create an initial prototype directly in Sinclair BASIC, which will allow me to test out the gameplay of the Awakeman game on a ZX Spectrum.
It has been a while since I coded in BASIC. My first job as a developer was to create small programs in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), so building this prototype will also act as a refresher to BASIC.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/11/10/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-1-my-development-setup/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 1 - My Development Setup</h2><div class=date>Nov 10, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>With side-projects like this one, I tend to leave the project unchanged for weeks. Therefore, I have found it good practice to write down the explicit details about my development setup; it makes it a lot easier to return to a project set on pause for a while.
As a general rule-of-thumb, my development setup has to be as platform-agnostic as possible. I think this is good practice. It allows a broader audience to follow-along when doing tutorials like this one, and it makes me independent from whether my next primary computer would be a Mac or a Windows PC.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/11/04/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-0-defining-the-project/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making a ZX Spectrum Game - Part 0 - Defining the Project</h2><div class=date>Nov 4, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>For sentimental reasons, I recently bought a ZX Spectrum from a dear colleague, but what to do with it? I could play games from my childhood, but why not make my own?! The Speccy, after all, was what created a generation of bedroom coders. Because of the 8-bit hardware limitations, this would be an excellent opportunity to flex my programming muscle, something I do not get to do all that often.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/10/04/revisiting-my-workplace-manifesto/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Revisiting My Workplace Manifesto</h2><div class=date>Oct 4, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>In July 2013, I posted my workplace manifesto on a Tumblr blog I had back then. It was a list of five priorities I wanted for a current – or future workplace; some of them felt a bit far-fetched or maybe even utopian, so how do they stack up today?
The Manifesto Without further ado here is the manifesto:
Be able to work on projects that excite you! Be able to put in the hours to finish the project and NOT be bound by the project’s price-tag.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/09/28/making-okr-work-for-small-development-teams/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Making OKR Work for Small Development Teams</h2><div class=date>Sep 28, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>A current trend in our industry is to formulate your goals as Objectives and Key Results (or OKR). However, there are a few challenges when implementing OKR, especially on a team level.
This post is an overview of how we use (or misuse) OKR on a small development team.
To give you a little context, our team consists of 3 developers and a product owner (that is I). We have a daily stand-up every day at noon and do refinement session once a week.</div></section></a><a href=/2020/09/23/make-your-presentations-fun/><section class=item><div><h2 class=title>Make Your Presentations Fun</h2><div class=date>Sep 23, 2020</div></div><div class=summary>When asked to do a presentation about something or the other, I struggle to find the motivation from time-to-time. Here are a few tips on what I do when preparing for a talk.
To quickly summarize, these are the steps I go through:
Somehow make the subject exciting Challenge myself Think about the presentation; can I make this entertaining to the participants Make the Subject Exciting Often I am asked to make a presentation about something I know by heart, which is great because this means that I probably have a presentation already on the subject tucked away somewhere that I can reuse.</div></section></a><div class=pagination><span class=next><a href=/page/2/>Older Posts <span class=arrow>→</span></a></span></div></div></main><footer id=footer><span class=copyright>© Copyright
