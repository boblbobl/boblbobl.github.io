My name is Lars Diget, and I’m a dad, husband, and maker. This blog intends to share any idea, thought, or inspiration, I might have, in the form of blog posts or photographs.

In my day job, I work for the best toy manufacturer in the world, the LEGO® Group, creating digital experiences for kids of all ages. Here I work as Senior Manager focusing on the engineering parts of our kids portfolio; which includes LEGO Play and kids.lego.com. I highly encourage and practice and show-don't-tell approach to workm sometimes it is just a lot easier to communicate something by showing it, this can be using [power point](https://boblbobl.com/2020/09/23/make-your-presentations-fun/), a small prototype, or sometimes I even use video to tell a story.

In my spare time, I love making stuff. I would consider myself an amateur photographer, preferable taking photos with analog cameras such as the medium format Hasselblad 500 C/M. The subject is most often the streets around where I live in Aarhus, Denmark.

I’m a proud dad to a girl and boy (twins) and married to my lovely wife for the last 10+ years.
