My name is Lars Diget, and I’m a dad, husband, developer/architect, and amateur photographer. This blog intends to share any idea, thought, or inspiration, I might have, in the form of blog posts or photographs.

In my day job, I work for the best toy manufacturer in the world, LEGO®, creating digital experiences for kids of all ages. I’m primarily involved with projects in the initial phases, even before they are actual projects. Most of my time, I create prototypes or investigate technologies, strategies, processes, and architecture. I evangelize teach co-workers in our tech stack in general and ways to leverage its capabilities.

I love making photographs in my spare time, preferably with analog cameras such as the medium format Hasselblad 500 C/M. The subject is most often the streets around where I live in Aarhus, Denmark.

I’m a proud dad to a girl and boy (twins) and married to my lovely wife for the last 10+ years.
