For sentimental reasons, I recently bought a ZX Spectrum from a dear colleague, but what to do with it? I could play games from my childhood, but why not make my own?! The Speccy, after all, was what created a generation of bedroom coders. Because of the 8-bit hardware limitations, this would be an excellent opportunity to flex my programming muscle, something I do not get to do all that often.

This post will be the first of many, where I will try to make a game for the ZX Spectrum. Here is what I have planed I will be covering:

- [Part 1. My Development Setup](https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/10/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-1-my-development-setup/)
- [Part 2. Prototyping in Sinclair BASIC](https://boblbobl.com/2020/11/17/making-a-zx-spectrum-game-part-2-the-initial-prototype-in-sinclair-basic/)
- Part 3. Cross-compiling using ZX Basic
- Part 4. Sprites and Animation
- Part 5. Running the Game on the Real Thing

It would also be fun to do a loading screen, make some SFX, and support joystick input as well, but let’s see how far I get.

## The Game

I was inspired to do this project after watching [a talk](https://youtu.be/cN8v2UTENSo) by [Josh Deprez](https://drjosh.dev/), where he created a game for a Macintosh Plus, so it makes only perfect sense that I make a ZX Spectrum port of that game (with Josh’s permission of course).

The objective of the game is simple. You play as [Awakeman](https://awakeman.com/). Awakeman can pick up limes that are scattered around the screen. For each lime you pick up, you earn a point. Simple, right?

Although the game is simple, it is perfect for demonstrating how to make a game for the ZX Spectrum, and there are lots of opportunities to extend the gameplay even further if needed.

## Stay Tuned

For the upcoming weeks, I will be sharing my progress getting from zero to a fully functional game running on my ZX Spectrum, so stay tuned.
